# Cars Api

To begin with, I want to say that this API is more of a portfolio project, a demonstration of my abilities as a developer on the Laravel framework. I tried to make this project as close to real as possible.

#### I want to tell you briefly what this API is

- Get a list of all cars
- Consider the car in detail as well as the photos attached to this one
- Registering and adding your car for sale purposes
- As a site admin you can add new engines, brands, cities that users can choose for their cars
- Detailed sorting of cars from brand to engine name
- Moderation of added cars
- Pagination
- etc.

I was inspired by one site for the sale of cars. There were cars on that site, not weird, where you can sort the cars however you want and also list your own cars for sale. That is, choose the brand, year of publication, price from and to, and so on. In general, I decided to implement this API on the Laravel framework.

In addition, i'd like to say that it's my first time when i use phpunit tests
